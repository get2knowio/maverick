# Specification Quality Checklist: Parameterized Workflow with Repo Verification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Clarifications resolved based on user input:
  - Scope: Support repositories accessible via the environment's configured GitHub contexts (GitHub.com and/or GitHub Enterprise), including public and private when credentials allow.
  - Failure policy: Auto-retry once on transient errors (timeouts/rate limits/5xx), then halt with clear error; no manual override.

- All items validated against spec: requirements are testable, success criteria measurable and tech-agnostic, acceptance scenarios and edge cases provided, and dependencies noted under "Dependencies & Constraints" in Requirements. Assumptions documented.

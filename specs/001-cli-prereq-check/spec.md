# Feature Specification: CLI Prerequisite Check

**Feature Branch**: `[001-cli-prereq-check]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A simple starter workflow that verifies that a series of pre-requisite CLI commands are available and authenticated. The two commands to verify are the gh CLI, whose authentication can be verified by \"gh auth status\", and \"copilot help\"."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Verify CLI prerequisites (Priority: P1)

As a developer setting up the project, I can run a readiness check that confirms my required tools are installed and authenticated so I know my environment is ready to work on the project.

**Why this priority**: Ensures contributors and CI can quickly detect setup issues and avoid wasted time on failed runs due to missing or unauthenticated tooling.

**Independent Test**: Run the readiness check in an environment with tools properly installed and authenticated; it reports success without requiring any other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated and the Copilot CLI is available, When I run the readiness check, Then it reports all prerequisites as passing and indicates the environment is ready.
2. Given the GitHub CLI is installed but not authenticated, When I run the readiness check, Then it reports authentication as failing and includes guidance on how to authenticate.
3. Given the Copilot CLI is not available, When I run the readiness check, Then it reports the missing tool and includes guidance on how to install/enable it.

### User Story 2 - Actionable guidance on failures (Priority: P2)

As a developer, if any prerequisite fails, I receive clear, step‑by‑step guidance to remediate the issue so I can complete setup without external help.

**Why this priority**: Reduces onboarding friction and support requests.

**Independent Test**: Temporarily remove or deconfigure a tool and verify the guidance directs remediation steps that resolve the issue.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the GitHub CLI is not authenticated, When I run the readiness check, Then it explains how to authenticate and links to official docs.
2. Given the Copilot CLI is not present, When I run the readiness check, Then it explains how to install/enable the CLI and links to official docs.

### Edge Cases

- Developer is offline: readiness check should still detect local installation state and provide non‑interactive guidance; it must not hang.
- Limited shells or PATH issues: if binaries are not on PATH, readiness check reports them as missing and suggests path validation steps.
- Permission or enterprise policy blocks: report the failure clearly and suggest contacting an administrator if applicable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST confirm that the GitHub CLI is available on PATH.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST determine whether the GitHub CLI is currently authenticated for the user and report the result.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST confirm that the standalone Copilot CLI binary is available on PATH by executing `copilot help` and report the result.
- **FR-004**: When any prerequisite fails, the system MUST provide human‑readable instructions to remediate (e.g., where to install, how to authenticate) without performing changes automatically.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a single readiness summary indicating Pass/Fail for each prerequisite and an overall Ready/Not Ready status.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST be non‑interactive by default (no prompts) and MUST NOT modify the user environment; no interactive remediation mode is included in scope.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST signal failure in a way that automation can detect (e.g., a non‑success result) when any prerequisite is not met.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide human‑readable output only; machine‑readable formats (e.g., JSON) are out of scope for this feature.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A first‑time developer can verify environment readiness in under 30 seconds end‑to‑end.
- **SC-002**: In environments with all prerequisites satisfied, the readiness check reports success ≥99% of runs (no flaky false negatives).
- **SC-003**: In environments with missing/unauthenticated prerequisites, at least 90% of developers report successful remediation within 5 minutes using the provided guidance.
- **SC-004**: CI or preflight automation can determine readiness outcome programmatically and fail fast when prerequisites are unmet.

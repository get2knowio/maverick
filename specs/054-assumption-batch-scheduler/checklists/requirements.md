# Specification Quality Checklist: Assumption Batch Scheduler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- ntfy is named in FR-009 and the delivery entities: the feature description
  mandates ntfy as the delivery channel (an existing optional dependency), so
  it is treated as a product constraint rather than an implementation leak.
- The CLI command name is deliberately deferred to planning (see Assumptions);
  the spec constrains its behavior (idempotent, cron-suitable, daemonless),
  not its name.
- All items pass; ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.

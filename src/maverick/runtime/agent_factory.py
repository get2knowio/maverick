"""Airframe runtime factory — `agents:` config block → constructed runtime.

Squadrons call :func:`runtime_for_agent` to materialise the
:class:`airframe.AgentRuntime` for a given role, optionally narrowed
to a per-complexity override pulled from
``actors.<workflow>.<actor>.tiers.<complexity>``.

Resolution order (highest → lowest):

1. ``binding_override`` — explicit binding the caller supplies. Used
   by squadrons to thread a complexity-tier override
   (``ImplementerTierConfig`` from
   :class:`maverick.config.ImplementerTiersConfig`) through to the
   factory.
2. ``agents.<role>`` from :class:`MaverickConfig.agents` — the role's
   default binding.

When neither layer supplies a binding, :class:`ValueError` is raised —
explicit failure is better than the legacy ``DEFAULT_TIERS`` fallback,
which silently picked a model the user hadn't authorised.

The factory dispatches via :func:`airframe.runtime_for`, so install-
state gating + `pip install airframe-agents[<extra>]` hints work
out of the box: a missing SDK surfaces as a clear ``ImportError`` here
rather than an opaque attribute error at execute time.

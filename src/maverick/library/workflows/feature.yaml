# Feature Workflow - Full Spec-Based Development
# ==============================================================================
#
# The "feature" workflow orchestrates a complete feature implementation from a
# task list through to pull request creation. It is Maverick's primary workflow
# for spec-based development, handling implementation, validation, review, and PR
# management in a single coordinated flow.
#
# WORKFLOW STAGES:
#   1. Init: Workspace initialization and branch sync
#   2. Implement: Execute all tasks from tasks.md
#   3. Validate: Run validation stages with automatic fix retry loop
#   4. Commit: Generate commit message and push changes
#   5. Review: Code review (optional, skippable)
#   6. Create PR: Generate PR body and create pull request
#
# INPUTS:
#   - branch_name (string, required): Feature branch name
#       The Git branch to work on. Will be created or checked out.
#       Example: "025-builtin-workflow-library"
#
#   - task_file (string, optional): Path to tasks.md file
#       Location of the task list to execute. If omitted, workflow will
#       auto-detect by searching for tasks.md in standard locations:
#       - specs/<branch-name>/tasks.md
#       - ./tasks.md
#       Example: "specs/025-builtin-workflow-library/tasks.md"
#
#   - skip_review (boolean, optional, default: false): Skip code review stage
#       Set to true to bypass the code review step. Useful for:
#       - Small changes or documentation updates
#       - Emergency fixes
#       - Work-in-progress PRs
#       Example: true
#
#   - dry_run (boolean, optional, default: false): Preview mode
#       Set to true to preview workflow actions without executing them.
#       Logs all planned operations instead of making actual changes.
#       Example: true
#
# CUSTOMIZATION POINTS:
#   - Override this workflow in your project to customize stages
#   - Adjust validation stages in validate-and-fix step inputs
#   - Replace review agent or add additional review steps
#   - Customize commit message generation via commit-and-push fragment
#   - Override fragments to customize common patterns across workflows
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   This workflow requires the following fragments (built-in or overridden):
#   - validate_and_fix: Validation-with-retry loop
#   - commit_and_push: Commit message generation and git push
#   - create_pr_with_summary: PR body generation and creation
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE:
#   # Basic usage (auto-detect task file)
#   maverick fly feature -i branch_name=025-builtin-workflow-library
#
#   # Explicit task file
#   maverick fly feature -i branch_name=025-builtin-workflow-library \
#     -i task_file=specs/025-builtin-workflow-library/tasks.md
#
#   # Skip code review
#   maverick fly feature -i branch_name=025-builtin-workflow-library \
#     -i skip_review=true
#
#   # Dry run (preview without executing)
#   maverick fly feature -i branch_name=025-builtin-workflow-library \
#     -i dry_run=true

# Input Declarations
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inputs:
  branch_name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Feature branch name

  task_file:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: |
      Path to tasks.md (auto-detect if omitted)

      Auto-detection: If not specified, searches for tasks.md in:
      1. specs/<branch-name>/tasks.md
      2. Current directory (./tasks.md)

  skip_review:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: Skip code review stage

  dry_run:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: |
      When true, log planned operations without executing them.
      Useful for previewing workflow actions before running.

      In dry-run mode:
      - Workspace initialization is logged but not executed
      - Task implementation is skipped (logs task list only)
      - Validation is skipped
      - No commits or pushes are made
      - No code review is performed
      - No PR is created

      Use this to preview what the workflow would do without making changes.

# Workflow Steps
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
steps:
  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 0: Preflight Checks
  # ============================================================================
  # Validate that all required tools and credentials are available before
  # starting the workflow. This prevents mid-workflow failures due to missing
  # or misconfigured tools.
  #
  # Checks:
  # - Anthropic API credentials (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN)
  # - Git is installed
  # - GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated (warning if not)
  # - Validation tools are installed (yamllint, ansible-lint, etc.)
  #
  # Output: PreflightCheckResult with success status and any errors/warnings
  # ============================================================================
  - name: preflight
    type: python
    action: run_preflight_checks
    kwargs:
      check_api: true
      check_git: true

      check_validation_tools: true
      validation_stages:

        - lint
        - test
    metadata:

        stage: "preflight"
        weight: 2

  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 1: Workspace Initialization
  # ============================================================================
  # Initialize the workspace by syncing the feature branch with the base branch
  # (typically main), ensuring we're starting from a clean, up-to-date state.
  #
  # This step:
  # - Checks out or creates the feature branch
  # - Syncs with origin/main (fast-forward if possible)
  # - Validates that the workspace is clean
  #
  # Output: Workspace state including current branch, base branch, and sync status
  # ============================================================================

        weight: 5

  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 2: Get Phase Names
  # ============================================================================
  # Extract phase names from tasks.md to enable phase-level iteration.
  # Each phase will be executed separately with Claude handling parallelization
  # of [P] marked tasks within the phase.
  #
  # Uses auto-detected task file from init step if not explicitly provided.

  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 2: Implementation by Phase
  # ============================================================================
  # Execute tasks phase-by-phase using the Implementer agent.
  #
  # This step iterates over each phase in tasks.md:
  # - Each phase is executed as a single Claude invocation
  # - Claude handles parallelization of [P] marked tasks within the phase
  # - After each phase: validate, commit, and checkpoint
  #
  # Benefits of phase-level execution:
  # - Coarser-grained control with better context coherence
  # - Claude decides optimal parallelization strategy
  # - Atomic commits per phase for cleaner git history
  # - Resume from any phase checkpoint on failure
  #
  # The implementer agent has access to:
  # - File read/write operations
  # - Git operations (commit, status, diff)
  # - Project context from the spec directory
  #
  # Output: Implementation results per phase including completed tasks

  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 4: Commit and Push
  # ============================================================================
  # Generate a commit message based on changes and push to remote.
  #
  # This invokes the commit_and_push fragment, which:
  # - Analyzes git diff and recent commits to understand changes
  # - Generates a conventional commit message
  # - Creates the commit with appropriate co-author attribution
  # - Pushes to the remote branch
  #
  # The commit message generation considers:
  # - Changed files and their context
  # - Recent commit history for style consistency
  # - Task list for understanding the "why" of changes
  #
  # Output: Commit SHA and push status

  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 5: Code Review (Optional)
  # ============================================================================
  # Perform automated code review using two specialized agents:
  # 1. Spec Reviewer - Reviews for spec compliance and completeness
  # 2. Technical Reviewer - Reviews for code quality and best practices
  #
  # This step is CONDITIONAL - it only runs when skip_review is false AND
  # dry_run is false.
  #
  # The review workflow:
  # - Gathers PR context including spec files
  # - Runs both reviewers in parallel
  # - Combines findings into a unified report
  #
  # To skip review for specific scenarios:
  # - Small changes: maverick fly feature -i skip_review=true
  # - Documentation updates: Often safe to skip
  # - Emergency fixes: May need to skip and review post-merge
  #
  # Output: Combined review findings from both perspectives

  # ============================================================================
  # Stage 6: Create Pull Request
  # ============================================================================
  # Generate PR body and create the pull request.
  #
  # This invokes the create_pr_with_summary fragment, which:
  # - Generates a comprehensive PR description summarizing changes
  # - Includes links to related issues and specs
  # - Creates the PR via GitHub CLI
  # - Applies appropriate labels and reviewers (if configured)
  #
  # The PR body generation considers:
  # - Commit history since branch divergence from base
  # - Task list and spec artifacts
  # - Review findings (if review was run)
  #
  # Default settings:
  # - base_branch: "main"
  # - draft: false (ready for review)
  #
  # To customize PR creation, override this step's inputs or override the
  # create_pr_with_summary fragment in your project.
